  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. It is a crucial measure for determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially for large-scale problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> indicates how much memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with input size.
