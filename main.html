	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>It quantifies the efficiency of an algorithm by assessing the time required to execute each statement within it. For instance, if a statement is executed repeatedly, the time complexity considers the number of times the statement is executed multiplied by the time required for each execution. </p
